      <div class="question-1">
        <p><h2 style="color: #fffece;">1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-1">
        <p>The first element that catched my eyes was the duration of time on the loading page. I noticed that it took about 10 seconds to load the page. It also had a timer run to 100 with a websiteâ€™s logo in the middle of the left corner. In addition, this website requires eye-catching and high interaction with users. Along with 3D graphics, an easy-to-see and gentle pastel tones background was a direct advantage. It created a sense of gentle harmony, highlighting the dominant object and the identification for the company brand.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-2">
        <p><h3 style="color:#fffece;">2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-2">
       <p<ul>
        <li>Move the mouse around the main object of the website to see how it changes the perspective (3D environments)</li>
        <li>Leave the mouse in front of the exterior floating next to the main object to display the table of contents.</li>
        <li>Scroll down to see each section of context.</li>
        <li>Click on everything until the mouse turns into a hand.</li>
        <li>Click on an arrow box that displays the name of the content.</li>
        <li>Move the mouse left and right to see how every floating frame of the table of contents changes direction.</li>
       </ul></p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-3">
        <p><h4 style="color: #fffece;">3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-3">
        <p>The interactive details, like the basketball and punchbag, made the objects feel more lifelike and engaging. This interactivity made me curious to explore the environment and click on everything to discover its functionality.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-4">
        <p><h5 style="color:#fffece;">4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h5></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-4">
        <p>In my two-minute interaction, I casually scrolled up and down to make the interactive model appear and disappear. Left-hand clicked on every object that popped up on the surface. I am sure that this is the easiest way to interact and find out the features of the website, and this is also the purpose of promoting their studio or their company.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-5">
        <p><h6 style="color:#fffece;">5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h6></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-5">
        <p>I am impressed by the way the interactive experience lets users freely discorevering all of the features but still leave some space for its original function. Otherwise, they also show that they need to recruit passionate and experienced people in the areas that they have identified as their strengths.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-6">
        <p><h6 style="color:#fffece;">6.  How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h6></p>
      </div>
