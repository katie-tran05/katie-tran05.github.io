      <div class="question-1">
        <p><h2 style="color: #fffece;">1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-1">
        <p>The first element that catched my eyes was the duration of time on the loading page. I noticed that it took about 10 seconds to load the page. It also had a timer run to 100 with a website’s logo in the middle of the left corner. In addition, this website requires eye-catching and high interaction with users. Along with 3D graphics, an easy-to-see and gentle pastel tones background was a direct advantage. It created a sense of gentle harmony, highlighting the dominant object and the identification for the company brand.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-2">
        <p><h3 style="color:#fffece;">2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-2">
       <p<ul>
        <li>Move the mouse around the main object of the website to see how it changes the perspective (3D environments)</li>
        <li>Leave the mouse in front of the exterior floating next to the main object to display the table of contents.</li>
        <li>Scroll down to see each section of context.</li>
        <li>Click on everything until the mouse turns into a hand.</li>
        <li>Click on an arrow box that displays the name of the content.</li>
        <li>Move the mouse left and right to see how every floating frame of the table of contents changes direction.</li>
       </ul></p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-3">
        <p><h4 style="color: #fffece;">3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-3">
        <p>The interactive details, like the basketball and punchbag, made the objects feel more lifelike and engaging. This interactivity made me curious to explore the environment and click on everything to discover its functionality.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-4">
        <p><h5 style="color:#fffece;">4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h5></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-4">
        <p>In my two-minute interaction, I casually scrolled up and down to make the interactive model appear and disappear. Left-hand clicked on every object that popped up on the surface. I am sure that this is the easiest way to interact and find out the features of the website, and this is also the purpose of promoting their studio or their company.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-5">
        <p><h6 style="color:#fffece;">5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h6></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-5">
        <p>I am impressed by the way the interactive experience lets users freely discorevering all of the features but still leave some space for its original function. Otherwise, they also show that they need to recruit passionate and experienced people in the areas that they have identified as their strengths.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-6">
        <p><h6 style="color:#fffece;">6.  How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h6></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-6">
        <p>Their official website showcases illustrations and artworks of their past projects. This is a key strategy, as their primary goals are to attract talent and highlight their areas of expertise - specifically marketing (with a focus on impactful visuals), UX/UI design, and video editing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-7">
        <p> <h6 style="color:#fffece">7.  What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h6>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-7">
        <p>I think that with this current amount of experience, this is sufficient for a first-time consumer quality. If there are any they can improve, they can accelerate the display speed in each section from 1 to 2 seconds. It is possible to try several ways to lead users from one page to another with more expressive transition, such as emphasizing the logo, adding the name of the necessary items.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-8">
        <p><h6 style="color:#fffece">8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h6></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer=8">
        <p>As I mentioned before, I believe this interactive experience is completely enough for the first-time user and for those who need to find jobs can carefully read the job description to understand more about their workflow and the studio’s motto. However, since it’s an interactive platform, it could take time just to wait for its loading page or its features. Furthermore, the amount of information that packs into each part of the interactive experience is marginally overwhelmed. Since it had a lot of empty space, it would take some time for users to reach the fundamental parts.

          In spite of those minor problems, this is, still, an interactive experience that satisfies the necessary conditions of a website with a high amount of intercommunication.

      <div class="question-9">
        <p><h6 style="color:#fffece"> 9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h6></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-9">
        <p>Through pure observation, I would come up with the idea that the studio has referenced the look and functionality of a buoyant 3D environment house decoration. This would refer to vivid and playful details that are built in three-dimensional surfaces. Otherwise, these designs reminded me about many 3D animated online banner ads.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-10">
        <p><h6 style="color:#fffece">10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h6></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-10">
        <p>When engaging with my research experience, I believe that the studio’s purpose is to perform their work in the most approachable way, which also needs consumers’ cooperation by clicking on noticeable details. Because of that, they just let users freely roaming around to discover about their business. Personally, since I prefer any websites or platforms to facilitate users to discover rather than follow a path, I would just click on everything to see what effects they are applying on.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-11">
        <p><h6 style="color:#fffece">11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h6></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-11">
        <p>The provided references showcase captivating and innovative cover designs that would effectively attract users, which is likely to draw them into amazement and curiosity to research more information. This is due to the attraction of the 3D environment, users are still a bit new to the virtual reality/three-dimensional environment, so applying these things to their finished products will easily impress the viewer.
        </p>

      <div class="question-12">
        <p><h6 style="color:#fffece">12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h6></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-12">
        <p>I would say the most frustrating part of the interaction is the web transition duration is too long. Additionally, the descriptions for each section are too lengthy; after reading the information, it takes too long to scroll back to the homepage.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question-13">
        <p><h6 style="color:#fffece">13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h6></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer-13">
        <p>The most satisfying part of the interaction that I come across is the seamless transition between webpages and the interaction with the objects on the website. The reason why I find them to be satisfying is the feeling of smooth delivery and direct message of their work progress. Additionally, I can experiment with the website's features and observe the outcomes of my interactions.</p>
